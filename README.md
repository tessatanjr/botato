# üç† Botato - No-code RAG chatbot builder

Botato is my Final Year Project that builds a low-cost, low-effort solution for creating customer-facing chatbots from messy and unstructured documents.

It is designed for SMEs, NGOs, and event planners who lack the technical expertise or resources to build chatbots, providing them with an end-to-end automated pipeline powered by GPT-4 and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

With Botato, creating a chatbot is as simple as uploading documents ‚Äî the system handles ingestion, preprocessing, indexing, and deployment.


## Features

- Multi-source document ingestion
    - PDFs (structured + scanned w/ OCR)
    - Web scraping (HTML pages)
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, NER, stopword removal)
- Smart chunking with sliding window overlap
- Vector embeddings & retrieval with FAISS
- GPT-4 powered chatbot (via OpenAI API)
- No-code interface to create and deploy chatbots
- Containerized with Docker for portability


## Tech Stack

### Backend
FastAPI + Uvicorn
Python libraries: pdfplumber, pytesseract, spaCy, BeautifulSoup4
